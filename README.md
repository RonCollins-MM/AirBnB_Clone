<i>(full readme to be updated later ....)</i>

This project is intended to solidify the concepts of higher level programming through building a real world project: <b>An AirBnB Clone</b>.

The clone  won't be an exact replica, but will have all the key components needed for the core learning.

It will be implemented in stages as follows, with each stage focused on building a different aspect of the platform:
<li>The command interpreter</li>
<li>The database</li>
<li>A web interface</li>
<li>Necessary API between the components</li>

<h1>The first stage is to build the command interpreter. </h1>
The main purpose of this interpreter is to have a terminal like environment where testing and debugging of the platform can occur during development.

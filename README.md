<h1> AirBnB Clone Project </h1>
<p>
This project is intended to be a hands-on learning process of building a full-scale software application that consists of:
<li>A web interface for user interaction</li>
<li>A Database Management System</li>
<li>A Server that hosts the main application</li>
<li>A debugging interface for the developer (in this case, a command line interpreter)</li>
</p>
<p>
All the components above are built in stages. The first stage is to build a small prototype of the main system - a basic command line interpreter that is able to manipulate <b><em>objects</em></b> that are stored in a JSON file storage system. This would mainly be implemented in <b>Python</b>Next, a static webpage would be built in <b>HTML</b> and <b>CSS</b> before functionality is added with <b>Javascript</b>. After that, a proper Database management system would be set up using <b>MySQL</b>. Finally, a server would be setup using tools like <b>Puppet</b> among others.
</p>
<h2>The Command Interpreter</h2>
The command interpreter is written in Python and its code is contained in the ``console.py`` module.
